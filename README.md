What is OpenExchangeRates library?
----------------------------------
OpenExchangeRates is a PHP library for the services provided by [Open Exchange Rates: a real-time exchange rates API for developers](http://openexchangerates.org).


Requirements
------------
* PHP 5.3+

* An Open Exchange Rates [APP ID](https://openexchangerates.org/signup), although at the moment you're able to make service calls without it, this will change in the near future, so it's probably better if you register an account and start using your APP ID right away.


Installation
------------
In order to start using the library you need to unpack it to your project and include it's autoloader wherever you need it:

`require_once 'OpenExchangeRates/Autoload.php';`


Documentation
-------------
At the moment there's not much documentation besides the one who's delivered with the code. Eitherway, you can check a few examples [here](http://github.com/jcsmorais/openexchangerates/wiki).


Contributing
------------
OpenExchangeRates library is an open source project. If you'd like to contribute, please do so by forking the project and making pull requests and/or by creating issues on github.
